# Tools necessary to read this documentation

The documentation is written in [Markdown file format][markdown] for text, and [PlantUML][plantUml]
for figures. Wile the markdown files are rendered by most git providers, plantUML files are not. 
Thus, readers are advised to install a tool to render PlantUML diagrams.
